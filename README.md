# Representative-Cycle-Synthesis
Hi everyone, Representative cycle synthesis is an advanced approach to build Representatuve drive cycles for heavy-medium-light duty vehicles for testing purpose in a virtual environment before launching it in real world. I have tried an approach and hope to come up with a conclusion with time. I am working on it and will keep updating my every day.
# First step
Load dataset: I have used light duty EV dataset for Representation purpose, you can use your own customised dataset for yourself.

Our interest shall be on Engine_Speed and Engine_Torque. We shall preprocess the dataset so that it becomes ready to use for our algorithms.
